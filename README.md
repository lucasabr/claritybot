# Clarity Bot

Author: Lucas Aguiar

Clarity is a discord bot coded in python using the discord.py library along with other various libraries and api's

Clarity is mostly error free and I am actively working on finding and catching errors as well as adding features

This bot contains 5+ features including fetching and formatting stock information, and starting server wide raffles that can be entered by reacting to a message.

## Notes

To run this bot on your own machine, you need to install the following libraries:

pip install -U python-dotenv
pip install discord.py
pip install pyjokes
pip install requests
pip install yfinance

You also would need your own .env file that has a token connecting to your own discord bot.

Once you do that, and retrieve a bot token, you can set DISCORD_TOKEN=(token) in your .env file.
